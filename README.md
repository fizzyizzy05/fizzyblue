fizzyblue is a custom bootc image based on Fedora Silverblue, with a minimal, opinionated choice of included changes. It is tailored towards gaming, software development and day to day use. fizzyblue is a custom image for my own devices, but if the changes sound useful to you, you're welcome to try it.

## Features
- Vanilla GNOME experience.
- Built on the latest release of Fedora.
- Homebrew pre-installed.
- Visual Studio Code pre-installed.
- Steam, Lutris and a variety of gaming tools included.

### Planned

## How to use
Run this command on an installed bootc system to use fizzyblue.
